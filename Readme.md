# Neural Networks and Its Applications
- This is a tutorial on Neural Networks and its applications.
- We discuss in details about what is a Neural Network, its architecture and how it works.
- Then we discuss an application of classifying a planar data using a Neural Network, with non-linear decision boundary and compare it with Logistic Regression.
- We also discuss about the hyperparameters and how they affect the performance of our network.
- Then we extend our discussion to deep neural networks and discuss an application of classifying a cat vs non-cat image using a deep neural network.
- Finally, we conclude our discussion with some examples of complex neural networks like CNNs, RNNs, etc.
