# Neural Networks and Its Applications
## Submitted By: Akshat Mittal, 200101011

- This is a tutorial on Neural Networks and its applications.
- We discuss in details about what is a Neural Network, its architecture and how it works.
- Then we discuss an application of classifying a planar data using a Neural Network, with non-linear decision boundary and compare it with Logistic Regression.
- We also discuss about the hyperparameters and how they affect the performance of our network.
- Then we extend our discussion to deep neural networks and discuss an application of classifying a cat vs non-cat image using a deep neural network.
- Finally, we conclude our discussion with some examples of complex neural networks like CNNs, RNNs, etc.

### Contents
- Please find the detailed tutorial in the [Jupyter Notebook](./Tutorial.ipynb)
- Dataset used for training is downloaded from Kaggle and can be found at [Link](./Datasets)
- Some utilities function used in the tutorial can be found at [Link](./Utils)

### Python Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- H5py
- Sklearn
- Make sure to install the above libraries before running the code using following command:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib h5py scikit-learn
```

### How to run an IPYNB file
- Inside Jupyter Notebook, you can run each cell of the IPYNB file by clicking on it and pressing `Shift + Enter` or by using the `Run` button in the toolbar.
- Alternatively, you can run the whole notebook in a single go by using the `Run All` option in the toolbar.
